pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 63.

pack breaking obsolete | Resource pack format has been increased to 48.

jar | New entry point `net.minecraft.gametest.Main` is present in the server jar, which starts the server and runs all available game tests.

game-test | Added game tests, which is an integrated system for testing aspects of the game. A test is made of parameters defining how the test should be executed, with a structure file for the base setup.

game-test | Test instances are defined in the `test_instance` registry with the following fields:
* `environment` - Namespaced id of the test environment to run the test with
* `structure` - Namespaced id of the structure to use for the test
* `max_ticks` - Positive integer representing the maximum ticks allowed before the test times out
* `setup_ticks` - Optional non-negative integer (0) representing ticks to wait between placing the structure and beginning the test
* `required` - Optional boolean (true) for if the test must pass for the full test suite to pass
* `rotation` - Optional rotation to apply to the structure, one of `none` (default), `clockwise_90`, `180`, and `counterclockwise_90`
* `manual_only` - Optional boolean (false) to not be included in automated test runs
* `sky_access` - Optional boolean (false) for whether the test requires sky access
* `max_attempts` - Optional integer (1) defining the number of attempts to run the test for
* `required_successes` - Optional integer (1) defining the number of successful attempts required for the test to be successful
* `type` - The type of test, one of `block_based` and `function`
* `function` - Namespaced if of the test function to run, only used for `function` type tests

game-test | Test environments are a way to group tests to be run together, defined in the `test_environment` registry. Each test environment has a `type` field, which determines the other required fields for the environment.
* Type `all_of` - A list of test environments `definitions`, either inlined or referenced
* Type `function` - Optional namespaced function ids `setup` and `teardown`
* Type `game_rules` - A list of game rules `bool_rules` and `int_rules`, each rule being an object with two fields `rule` and `value`
* Type `weather` - Weather `weather` to set, being one of `clear`, `rain`, and `thunder`
* Type `time_of_day` - The non-negative number of ticks `time` to set the day

block | Added the `test_block` block used for implementing block-based game tests. It has four modes:
* `start` - Triggers a redstone pulse upon the start of the test
* `log` - Logs a message to the log file when powered by redstone
* `fail` - Fails the test when powered by redstone
* `accept` - Completes the test when powered by redstone

command | Added the `/test` command, used to create and run tests. It has the following syntax options:
* `test clearall [<radius>]`
* `test clearthat`
* `test clearthese`
* `test create <test> [<width>] [<height> <depth>]`
* `test locate <selector>`
* `test resetclosest`
* `test reseetthese`
* `test resetthat`
* `test pos [<variable>]`
* `test run <selector> [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]`
* `test runclosest [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]`
* `test runfailed [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]`
* `test runmultiple <selector> [<amount>]`
* `test runthat [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]`
* `test runthese [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]`
* `test stop`
* `test verify <tests>`

command predicate breaking | The item slot `horse.saddle` has been renamed to `saddle`, and supports any entity that can equip a Saddle.

text breaking | In the `show_text` hover event action, `text` has been renamed to `value`.

tag data | Added entity tag `#can_equip_saddle` to contain all entities which can be equipped with a saddle. This does not control whether the saddle will function.

entity nbt breaking | The `ArmorItems`, `HandItems`, and `body_armor_item` fields have been merged into a single field `equipment`.
* Valid equipment slots include `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `body`, and `saddle`.
* If not specified, the entire `equipment` field is removed.

entity nbt | The saddle data format has been unified between mobs such as Horses and Pigs, becoming a new equipment slot `equipment.saddle`. This replaces the `Saddle` boolean flag from Pigs and Striders.

entity nbt | Added `saddle` slot to the `drop_chances` field.

entity nbt breaking | The `FallDistance` field has been renamed to `fall_distance`, and now takes a double instead of a float.

item component breaking | In the `weapon` item components, the `damage_per_attack` field has been renamed to `item_damage_per_attack`.

item component | The `equippable` item component can now be applied to the `saddle` slot. If the component allows it, any mob can have equipment added in te `body` slot.

item component | The `equippable` item component has a new optional boolean field `equip_on_interaction`. If true, players can equip the item onto a mob by right-clicking.

entity item component | Added a set of components for both entities and items for configuring variants and appearances. If present on a spawning item such as a spawn egg or mob bucket, the components will be applied to the entity. The components are as follows:
* `villager/variant` - one of `desert`, `jungle`, `plains`, `savanna`, `snow`, `swamp`, `taiga`
* `wolf/variant` - namespaced id from `wolf_variant` registry
* `wolf/collar` - one of 16 dye colors
* `fox/variant` - one of `red`, `snow`
* `salmon/size` - one of `small`, `medium`, `large`
* `parrot/variant` - one of `red_blue`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow_blue`, `gray`
* `tropical_fish/pattern` - one of `kob`, `sunstreak`, `snooper`, `dasher`, `brinely`, `spotty`, `flopper`, `stripey`, `glitter`, `blockfish`, `betty`, `clayfish`
* `tropical_fish/base_color` - one of 16 dye colors
* `tropical_fish/pattern_color` - one of 16 dye colors
* `mooshroom/variant` - one of `red`, `brown`
* `rabbit/variant` - one of `brown`, `white`, `black`, `white_splotched`, `gold`, `salt`, `evil`
* `pig/variant` - namespaced id from `pig_variant` registry

* `painting/variant` - namespaced id from `painting_variant` registry
* `llama/variant` - one of `creamy`, `white`, `brown`, `gray`
* `axolotl/variant` - one of `lucy`, `wild`, `gold`, `cyan`, `blue`
* `cat/variant` - namespaced id from `cat_variant` registry
* `cat/collar` - one of 16 dye colors
* `sheep/color` - one of 16 dye colors
* `shulker/color` - one of 16 dye colors

item component | Tooltips for Bucket of Tropical Fish and Painting items are based off of new components instead of `minecraft:bucket_entity_data` and `minecraft:entity_data`.

entity predicate breaking | New optional field `components` has been added to entity predicates to match the components of the entity. The following entity sub-predicates are removed and replaced with the `components` predicate and variant entity components: `minecraft:axolotl`, `minecraft:fox`, `minecraft:mooshroom`, `minecraft:rabbit`, `minecraft:horse`, `minecraft:llama`, `minecraft:villager`, `minecraft:parrot`, `minecraft:salmon`, `minecraft:tropical_fish`, `minecraft:painting`, `minecraft:cat`, `minecraft:frog`, `minecraft:wolf`, `minecraft:pig`, and the `color` field from `minecraft:sheep`.

assets | Added the following new equipment asset layer types:
* `pig_saddle`
* `strider_saddle`
* `camel_saddle`
* `horse_saddle`
* `donkey_saddle`
* `mule_saddle`
* `skeleton_horse_saddle`
* `zombie_horse_saddle`

assets texture breaking | Two textures have been moved to support equipment assets for saddles:
* `entity/pig/pig_saddle.png` -> `entity/equipment/pig_saddle/saddle.png`
* `entity/strider/strider_saddle.png` -> `entity/equipment/strider_saddle/saddle.png`

assets texture breaking | The following textures have been split from the base entity texture to qupport quipment assets for saddles:
* `entity/camel/camel.png` -> `entity/equipment/camel_saddle/saddle.png`
* `entity/horse/horse_<variant>.png` -> `entity/equipment/horse_saddle/saddle.png`
* `entity/horse/donkey.png` -> `entity/equipment/donkey_saddle/saddle.png`
* `entity/horse/mule.png` -> `entity/equipment/mule_saddle/saddle.png`
* `entity/horse/horse_skeleton.png` -> `entity/equipment/skeleton_horse_saddle/saddle.png`
* `entity/horse/horse_zombie.png` -> `entity/equipment/zombie_horse_saddle/saddle.png`

assets item | Added `component` data source to `select` item models, returning the value of the component on the item. It takes field `component`, a namespaced id of the component type.
