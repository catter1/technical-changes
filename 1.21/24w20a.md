pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 44.

structure | Changed the `dimension_padding` field to accept an object with fields `bottom` and `top` to individually define the vertical padding. The old format of a single integer is still valid, which will apply the same value to both top and bottom padding.

enchantment | The `weight` field has an upper bound of 1024.

enchantment | The `max_level` field has an upper bound of 255.

entity predicate | Added new `movement_affected_by` option to entity location predicate, adding requirements on blocks directly below the entity affecting its movement.
