pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 44.

structure | Changed the `dimension_padding` field in `jigsaw` structures to accept an object with fields `bottom` and `top` to individually define the vertical padding. The old format of a single integer is still valid, which will apply the same value to both top and bottom padding.

enchantment | Changed the `weight` field in enchantments. It now has an upper bound of `1024`.

enchantment | Changed the `max_level` field in enchantments. It now has an upper bound of `255`.

entity predicate | Added new `movement_affected_by` option to entity location predicates, adding requirements on blocks directly below the entity affecting its movement.
